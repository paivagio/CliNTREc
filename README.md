### 1. Sintax

**Prefix:** `python main.py`

| Parameter | Default | Description  |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| `-h`     |     | Help message |
| `-i`     | temp    | Input folder |
| `-o`     | temp  | Output folder |
| `-t`     | ec.txt  | Clinical trial filename |
| `-id`    |   | Clinical trial ID |
| `-e`     |   | Patient's EHR filename |
| `-s`     | False  | Run cohort selection system |

### 2. Input format

This system accepts text file input for both clinical trial and EHR tasks. The text file needs to be in a specific format that is showcased in the example files in **temp** folder. It is also possible to use a clinical trial's ID. For detailed information please refer to the descriptions bellow. 

#### Clinical trial text file
> The clinical trial text file consists of two lines, the first containing the inclusion criteria and the second the exclusion criteria

#### Clinical trial ID
> The clinical trial ID must be collected from [ReBEC (Registro Brasileiro de Ensaios ClÃ­nicos)](https://ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/) and can be found on the header of any clinical trial (see picture bellow).

```

- From ID

```bash
python main.py -i "input folder" -o "output folder" -id "trial id"
```

### 4. EHR Information Extraction
